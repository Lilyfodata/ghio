For this exercise, try these things:

Make your script print another line.
Make your script print only one of the lines.
Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.

ex3
Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python? Start python this way again and using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.


ex5
Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.
Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.
Search online for all of the Python format characters.

Try more format characters. %r is a very useful one. It's like saying "print this no matter what."
